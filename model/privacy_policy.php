        <p>
            We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:
            <ul>

                <li>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved</li>
            </ul>
